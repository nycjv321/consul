# consul-client
## About
A barebones consul client/lib/sdk for consul. Currently this lib only supports a few operations on Consul K/V. More are planned and PRs are welcomed!

## Why?
1) Wanted a dead simple API.
2) Wanted a client that supported recent versions of SSL and didn't require me rewriting an existing lib to implement it (see point 3)
3) Why not?
